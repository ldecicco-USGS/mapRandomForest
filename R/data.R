#' [DATASET] ORIGINAL monthly streamflow and baseflow summaries
#'
#' This dataset contains monthly streamflow and baseflow summaries for a list of USGS gage IDs pulled
#' from a shapefile of gage drainage basins. The dataset contains almost 21,300 missing or negative
#'  flow values, which were removed in subsequent processing in the original scripts.
#'
#' This dataset also includes results for additional gage IDs that were removed in the original scripts
#' before training the random forest trees. The sites removed in subsequent processing were:
#'
#'   "03320500","03383000","03434500","03436100","03438000","03438220",

#'   "03599450","03600500","03601630","03604000","03433641"
#'
#'   The variables are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item siteNo. USGS gage ID
#'   \item Date. Year and month associated with summary statistic (YYYY-MM)
#'   \item Flow. Monthly mean streamflow in cubic feet per second

#' [DATASET] Unedited ORIGINAL random forest model inputs
#'
#' This dataset was used as raw input to the random forest model scripts. The dataset combines the output

#' location, elevation, and generalized geologic units.
#'
#' In later processing steps, the fields pertaining to the digital elevation map statistics and to
#' basin geology were dropped from the list of random forest model inputs.
